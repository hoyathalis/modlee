    "# Time Series Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of building a multivariate time series classification model using Modlee and `PyTorch`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Time series classification is a task where models predict categorical labels based on sequential input data. We will use a dataset that contains time series data representing different car outlines extracted from video footage. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Currently, Modlee does not support recurrent LSTM operations. Instead, we will focus on non-recurrent models suited for time series data, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers, which can effectively capture sequential patterns without requiring recurrent layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "[![Open in Kaggle](https://kaggle.com/static/images/open-in-kaggle.svg)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/modlee/time-series-classification)\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will import the the necessary libraries and set up the environment. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "import torch\n",
    "import os\n",
    "import modlee\n",
    "import lightning.pytorch as pl\n",
    "from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, we will set up the `modlee` API key and initialize the `modlee` package. You can access your `modlee` API key [from the dashboard](https://www.dashboard.modlee.ai/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace `replace-with-your-api-key` with your API key.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "modlee.init(api_key=\"replace-with-your-api-key\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we will use consists of time series data that represent outlines of four different types of cars (sedan, pickup, minivan, SUV) extracted from traffic videos using motion information. Each vehicle is mapped onto a 1-D series, where each series captures the vehicleâ€™s outline. The objective is to classify these series into one of the four classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we will manually download the dataset from Kaggle and upload it to the environment. Visit the [Time Series Classification dataset page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/modlee/time-series-classification-data) on Kaggle and click the **Download** button to save the dataset to your local machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "Copy the path to the donwloaded files, which will be used later. \n",
    "\n",
    "To load the data, we create a function that reads the files and processes them into `PyTorch` tensors. Each time series entry has features representing the outline of a vehicle, with the first column in the dataset being the target label.\n",

    "    y = data.iloc[:, 0].values  # The first column represents the target (car type)\n",
    "    X = data.iloc[:, 1:].values  # The rest of the columns represent the time series features\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Convert the features and labels to PyTorch tensors\n",
    "    X = torch.tensor(X, dtype=torch.float32).unsqueeze(-1)  # Add a dimension for input size\n",
    "    y = torch.tensor(y, dtype=torch.long)  # Ensure labels are in long tensor format for classification\n",
