    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of building a tabular regression model using the Modlee package. We will utilize the `California Housing` dataset, which contains information about housing prices in California, to predict house prices based on various features. \n",

    "\n",
    "First, we will import the the necessary libraries and set up the environment. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "import torch\n",
    "import os\n",
    "import modlee\n",
    "import lightning.pytorch as pl\n",
    "from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset\n",
    "from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
    "import pytest\n",
    "from utils import check_artifacts\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, we will set up the `modlee` API key and initialize the `modlee` package. You can access your `modlee` API key [from the dashboard](https://www.dashboard.modlee.ai/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace `replace-with-your-api-key` with your API key.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "modlee.init(api_key=\"replace-with-your-api-key\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we will load the `California Housing` dataset, which we will use for our regression task. This dataset is readily available through the `fetch_california_housing` function from the `sklearn.datasets` module. We will convert the features and target values into `PyTorch` tensors for compatibility with our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def load_california_housing_data():\n",
    "    # Fetch the California housing dataset\n",
    "    data = fetch_california_housing()\n",
    "    X, y = data.data, data.target  # Separate features (X) and target (y)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Convert features and target to PyTorch tensors for compatibility\n",

    "\n",
    "Once we have the data, the next step is to split it into training and testing sets. This allows us to train our model on one set of data and validate its performance on another.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After splitting the data, we need to create `TensorDataset` objects for our training and testing sets. This will facilitate easy loading of the data during the training process. We create `DataLoader` objects for both training and testing datasets.\n",

    "Now it's time to define our regression model using Modlee's framework. We will create a class called `TabularRegression` that inherits from `modlee.model.TabularRegressionModleeModel`. This class will define our neural network architecture and the training process.\n",
